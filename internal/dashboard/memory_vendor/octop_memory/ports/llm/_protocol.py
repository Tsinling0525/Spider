"""LLM workload tier.

- ``light``: per-session_end candidate extraction, 5-check escalation,
  alias disambiguation. ~5-10 calls/day for a heavy user. Uses smaller /
  cheaper / lower-latency models (e.g. host's small-tier Ollama).
- ``heavy``: daily cross-session candidate consolidation, entity page
  re-summarization. ~1-2 calls/day. Uses the host's strongest model.

Tier selection is the host's call (``HostLLMClient`` translates ``light``/
``heavy`` to whatever model identifier the host expects). For
``OpenAICompatClient``, both tiers use ``model`` unless ``model_heavy``
is set — that's fine for dev validation, the production path gets the
real fallback chain.
