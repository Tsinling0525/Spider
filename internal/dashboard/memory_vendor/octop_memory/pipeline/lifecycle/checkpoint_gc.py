"""Checkpoint retention pruning — shrink the LangGraph checkpointer tables.

LangGraph's ``SqliteSaver`` has no built-in retention: every graph step
(every AI turn / tool call) inserts a full-state ``checkpoints`` row (plus
``writes`` rows) and nothing ever deletes it, short of
:meth:`Memory.delete_thread` which is all-or-nothing (wipe the *entire*
thread history). For long-lived threads that are never deleted outright,
the ``checkpoints``/``writes`` tables grow without bound — this is the
#1 driver of unbounded ``.sqlite`` file growth (see repo-wide sqlite
bloat investigation).

This module adds the missing middle ground: per ``(thread_id,
checkpoint_ns)`` stream, keep only

* the newest ``keep_last`` checkpoints (default **1** — chat history
  and the next turn read the latest parent snapshot, not a stitch of
  older copies), and/or
* checkpoints newer than ``keep_days`` days,

and delete everything else (plus their ``writes`` rows). The two knobs
are OR'd together — a checkpoint survives if it satisfies *either*
condition — and the single newest **parent** checkpoint
(``checkpoint_ns=""``) is always kept, so ``get_thread_state()`` /
``get_tuple()`` never breaks.

SqliteSaver is a **delta** store: the newest parent row often omits
``messages`` from ``channel_values`` even when ``channel_versions``
shows they exist. The transcript is reconstructed by walking the parent
chain plus ``writes``. Deleting ancestors before inlining that list
leaves a self-inconsistent survivor (dangling ``parent_checkpoint_id``,
empty ``messages``) — chat history then falls back to JSONL text.

So this module **seals** the latest parent first: replay ``messages``
into ``channel_values`` as a new root snapshot, *then* delete older
rows. If replay yields nothing while the channel is still versioned,
ancestor deletion is skipped for that thread.

Finished ``tools:*`` (and any other non-empty ``checkpoint_ns``)
subgraph streams can be dropped entirely **after** the parent is
sealed. In-flight and HITL-paused threads are skipped unless
``force_drop_subgraphs`` is set.

SQLite-only (same restriction as :mod:`octop_memory.pipeline.lifecycle.gc`,
D46-C): checkpoint_id is a UUIDv6 string (see
``langgraph.checkpoint.base.id.uuid6``) whose lexicographic string order
matches chronological order (LangGraph's own ``list()`` relies on this
via ``ORDER BY checkpoint_id DESC``). That means both "keep last N" and
"keep last X days" can be expressed as plain SQL — no need to
deserialize any checkpoint blob to find a timestamp.

Unlike :mod:`octop_memory.pipeline.lifecycle.gc`, deletions here are
NOT journaled: checkpoint/write rows are LangGraph execution-state
plumbing, not user-facing memory facts, and :meth:`Memory.delete_thread`
(the existing all-or-nothing path) doesn't journal either — this keeps
behaviour consistent.
