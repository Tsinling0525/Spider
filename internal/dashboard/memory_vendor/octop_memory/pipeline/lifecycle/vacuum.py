"""Storage-level space reclamation (RISK-026 vacuum plan, ADR-025).

Deleting rows (lifecycle GC, checkpoint pruning, journal retention) only
marks the space they occupied as reusable — it never shrinks the on-disk
footprint on its own, on either backend. This module is the second half
of that story: giving the reclaimed space back.

The two backends need genuinely different treatment, not a shared code
path with an `if backend == "postgres"` branch bolted on:

* **SQLite** has no engine-level background reclaim process.
  :func:`nudge_vacuum` runs ``PRAGMA incremental_vacuum`` in small,
  bounded batches (cheap, safe with live traffic once
  ``auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL`` is on — new files start that way, see
  ADR-027; hosts schedule this via :func:`run_idle_maintenance`).
  :func:`compact_vacuum` runs a full ``VACUUM`` (rebuilds the whole
  file, exclusive lock — only during a confirmed idle window; still
  manual, not on the idle tick).

* **PostgreSQL** already runs `autovacuum` in the background by default,
  reclaiming dead-tuple space for reuse without blocking readers or
  writers — the SQLite problem this module mostly exists to solve
  doesn't exist on Postgres. :func:`nudge_vacuum` here just runs a plain
  (non-blocking) ``VACUUM`` on the specific high-churn tables
  (``journal`` plus LangGraph's ``checkpoints``/``checkpoint_blobs``/
  ``checkpoint_writes``, none of which have a ``namespace`` column — see
  RISK-026) as an on-demand nudge on top of autovacuum.
  :func:`compact_vacuum` runs ``VACUUM FULL`` per table, which — unlike
  SQLite's ``VACUUM`` — takes an ``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`` lock that blocks
  *reads* too, and does so on tables shared by every namespace on that
  Postgres instance. Callers should treat it as a manual, ops-invoked
  operation, not something to schedule blindly (see ADR-025).

Three entry points, split by *what they cost* rather than by backend
(the CLI mirrors this as ``octop-memory db check`` / ``vacuum`` / ``compact``):

* :func:`check_storage` — read-only; never mutates, always safe.
* :func:`nudge_vacuum` — cheap and bounded; safe with live traffic.
* :func:`compact_vacuum` — heavy; holds an exclusive lock.

Both backends' :func:`nudge_vacuum` are safe to call from a host's idle
timer (see ``octop-harness``'s ``MemoryMiddleware``). :func:`compact_vacuum`
is not — it must only run when the caller has confirmed there's no
concurrent traffic (for Postgres: no other namespace/host either, since
the affected tables are shared — see RISK-026's Postgres section).

The mutating pair still take a ``dry_run`` flag, but it is *not* the
user-facing inspection surface — :func:`check_storage` is (ADR-025).
``dry_run`` exists so those previews stay exact (they predict the real
outcome rather than reporting a bare zero), and so ``check_storage``
can reuse them; the CLI deliberately exposes no ``--dry-run`` option.
