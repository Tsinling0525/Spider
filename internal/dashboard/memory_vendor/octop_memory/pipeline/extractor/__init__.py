"""Candidate Extractor — turns a batch of L0 raw events into L1 candidates.

Orchestration:
1. Render the prompt v2 against the input raw events
2. Call ``LLMClient.call_llm(tier="light", response_format="json")``
3. Parse the JSON response (with one retry if parse fails)
4. Run post-hoc validation (referential integrity + anti-dilution warnings)
5. Return a ``ExtractionResult``

The Extractor never persists anything itself — that's the caller's job
(via ``Memory.add_candidate`` / promotion worker). This keeps the extractor
side-effect-free, easy to test with ``MockLLMClient``, and allows the
caller to inspect / drop candidates before they hit storage.

When the LLM is unavailable (``LLMClientError``, ``OSError``, or
``TimeoutError``) or the parse retries are exhausted, ``extract`` returns
an ``ExtractionResult`` with an empty ``candidates`` list and
``failure_reason`` set. Other exceptions propagate. The promotion worker /
CLI surface this state as ``extractor_failed`` if the caller tracks it.
