"""5-check promotion logic for L1 Candidate → L2 AtomCard (design §8.3.2).

Demotion-only philosophy: every candidate becomes an atom by default. We
only step away from the happy path in three cases:

1. ``importance=low AND confidence=low`` → drop (chit-chat noise)
2. Existing atom is identical → merge (no new row)
3. Existing atom directly contradicts → needs_review / conflict

The five checks run in fixed order. The first one that produces a
terminal outcome wins; later checks are skipped. This module is **pure
rule**: it never calls an LLM. The optional LLM escalation hooks
(check 3 alias disambiguation, check 4/5 grey-zone semantic match) are
exposed via the ``LLMEscalationHook`` Protocol so M2.5b can inject them
without touching the orchestration loop.
